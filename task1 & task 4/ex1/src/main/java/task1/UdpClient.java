 * <p>
 * First try to create a UDP socket with the {@link InetSocketAddress} to the server as a constructor argument
 * to the {@link DatagramSocket}. Before doing anything else, try to run this code. Does it give an exception?
 * Why/Why not? And what would a TCP socket do?

 * <p>
 * Second, send the text message from the {@link #MESSAGE} constant to the server and check to see what is actually
